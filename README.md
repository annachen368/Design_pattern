# Design_pattern

## The Singleton Pattern


## The Command Pattern
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

The primary design goal is to keep the remote control code as simple as possible so that it doesn't require changes as new vendor classes are produced.
